                                Since Portland's Resistance is specifically working to fight white nationalism
                                and other causes of oppression in Oregon, the threats you face come from multiple
                                directions. You could face outside forces such as white nationalist groups or the government
                                intercepting your communications. This could lead to planned protests being met with
                                violence, sabotage or other opposition. It could also lead to a man-in-the-middle attack
                                that causes deception and miscommunication between group members. The risk is not limited
                                to information about organizing, but includes personal data of members and activists.

                                In order to prevent or mitigate possible attempts at surveillance and disruption, 
                                we recommend that Portland's Resistance utilize secure communication methods to 
                                continue organizing and planning. There is no reason to think that in 
                                today's political climate and threats of culture war that either the government or 
                                other groups wouldn't attempt to sabotage and threaten the work of Portland's 
                                Resistance. To stay a step ahead of such attempts would increase the safety of 
                                members and activists, as well as accelerate progress of the group's mission.

                                Portland's Resistance might choose to use an end-to-end encrptyted messaging 
                                system such as Signal that would minimize the risk of several modes of oppression
                                being used against them. Using an encrypted messaging system would ensure that 
                                only the intended recipients can read the messages. Such a system would
                                make it difficult for authorities to monitor and gather evidence on the group's activities,
                                and if access was gained, the messages would still have to be deciphered, which, with
                                today's encryption technology and the use of hash functions, is essentially infeasible.
